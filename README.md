# Fidget Shuriken

https://pocketninja.github.io/enjine-fidget-shuriken/

This is a rudimentary example made with Enjine, a toy ECS JS game engine I'm chipping away at.

It is using contemporary features of JavaScript, such as native classes and visibility. YMMV.

NB: The repo for Enjine itself is not publicly available right now - it's very unfinished and lacks many core features. 

NB: For best results, please use a desktop browser. Input tracking is designed to work with a mouse for the time being.
